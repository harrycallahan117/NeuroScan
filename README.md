# NeuroScan
**A mechanized brain tumor classification framework**
This project utilizes TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to handle MRI pictures and precisely classify tumors into their categories. The model is prepared on a preprocessed dataset, with a parcel of the dataset saved for approval to screen execution and avoid overfitting.
